contractnli_139,"Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement (Data Protection) Background Information Where an organisation or a non-NHS agency or individual is engaged to carry out or support an NHS or public sector function, the appropriate confidentiality and security requirements must be agreed. The standard specified in the agreement should be consistent with the Information Governance standards expected of NHS and other public sector organisations. These are based on the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998 and ‘common law duty of confidentiality’. The Data Protection Act 1998 reiterates this point and makes it a legal requirement that effective agreements exist where a third party processes data. In addition for support functions that do not directly process data but may become party to it, it is a requirement to keep information confidential. In addition the organisation requires any contracted individual or organisation (in this case LSPs) to respect any commercial confidentiality and intellectual property claimed by the organisation in the provision and handling of documentation and information. Any patient information, particularly their health or treatment details, is highly sensitive. If such information was leaked to the wrong people, it could cause severe embarrassment to the patients concerned, their families and to the organisation. There could be legal action following such a breach of confidentiality. In addition any inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of commercially sensitive information or unlicensed reuse of intellectual property could be subject to legal action. The Agreement: This agreement relates to requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998, the ‘common law duty of confidentiality’ and the Freedom of Information Act (2000). 1.
