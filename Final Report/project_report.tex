\begin{abstract}
	This project aims to develop a high-quality, labeled dataset of legal contract clauses to support AI-driven contract analysis. We introduce a hybrid clause segmentation pipeline that merges regex-based heuristics, semantic similarity using sentence embeddings, and supervised boundary classification to accurately detect clause boundaries in unstructured legal text. Building on this foundation, we assign contract-type-specific clause labels and explore intra-contract relationships by analyzing semantic and structural connections between clauses within the same document. Our work enhances the granularity and contextual understanding of contract language, enabling more robust clause classification, summarization, and fairness analysis.

\section*{Introduction}

Legal contracts are complex documents filled with dense, technical language that can be difficult to analyze and understand without expert knowledge. With the growing demand for AI-assisted legal tools, there is a critical need for structured, high-quality datasets that support tasks like clause segmentation, classification, and summarization. Existing legal NLP datasets, such as CUAD and ContractNLI, provide useful foundations, but they often lack fine-grained clause-level annotations and domain-specific context.

Our project addresses this gap by building a dataset and system capable of accurately identifying and labeling contract clauses. We implement a hybrid clause segmentation pipeline that combines regex-based patterns, semantic similarity modeling, and supervised classification to detect clause boundaries with high precision. After segmentation, we apply contract-type-specific clause categorization and explore intra-contract clause relationships to model how clauses interrelate within the same legal context.

This work contributes a reproducible framework for fine-grained contract analysis, with applications in contract review, compliance checking, and legal summarization. Our code and documentation are available at:

code and the model? 
If they did release the code and the model, is it possible to build
on their work directly and improve it?}

Here is also an example of how to render math inline
such as \(f(x) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \cdot x\). Or you can render it as a block

\[
f(x) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \cdot x
\]

or numbered
\begin{equation}
f(x) = \phi_0 + \phi_1 \cdot x.
