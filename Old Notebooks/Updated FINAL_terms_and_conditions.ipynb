The purchase price for such items will be equal to your depreciated cost (determined below) or fair market value, whichever is less. The cost will be determined based upon a five (5) year straight-line depreciation of original costs. For equipment that is five (5) or more years old, the parties agree that fair market value will be deemed to be ten percent (10%) of the equipment's original cost. The fair market value of tangible assets must be determined without reference to good will, going-concern value, or other intangible assets.

We may exercise this option by delivering a notice of intent to purchase to you within 30 days after the expiration or termination of this Agreement. During that 30-day period, you agree not to dispose of, transfer, or otherwise hinder our ability to exercise our rights with respect to your assets. 16.2.3. If we exercise our option to purchase, we may setoff all amounts due to us under this Agreement and the cost of the appraisal (if any), against any payment due to you. 16.2.4.
